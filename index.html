        <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
        <iframe style="width: 450px; height: 300px; overflow: hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Cecilezz/full/SboAM6Z76" title="Worldship Interactive Mood Board"></iframe>
        <br>
        <p>This program is based on an imaginary world that I've been building. This is almost like a small interactive mood board/concept art for the world. The world sets in a futuristic dystopian future, where an advanced civilization created a spaceship to foster children. The children are going to compete with each other to earn a spot to go back to their mother planet, where the civilization settles. It is a world full of fights, struggles, pressure, and in the end, the civilization comes to an end, and everything becomes nonsense. To convey this mood of an apocalypse world, I created this concept art with an old radio in the middle of future city ruins -- I always think that the combination of old objects and futuristic world creates a great sense of juxtaposition to me. It almost compresses the untouchable concept of time into a flat, 2D image. After such a long time, the radio is still running, playing sounds from the far, distant past. </p>

        <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>

        <a href="https://worldship.glitch.me">Final: Worldship HTML Demo</a>
        <p>This project further expands on the concept of project 1. It aims to create an elevator pitch deck for the speculative project, expressing the mood of the game world. I already have a developed pitch deck explaining the rationale and form of the project. Thus, I want this demo to illustrate the atmosphere of the game world. I want it to be able to take audiences instantly into the narrative. </p>

        <p>“Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology” addresses the contribution women made regarding computer art. The field of technology and computers is largely recognized as a male-dominated industry. The most prominent individuals being remarked on textbook, news, and moreover by the society in general are males. The effort women put into this domain has been ignored in the history. They are, just as the article stated, a lot of times “unnamed.” It is delightful to learn that these efforts are starting to become more widely recognized. Also, the power of computer 0in making arts is terrific. It has so much inconceivable influence not only on how we create art but also how we understand and categorize art.

            “Sight as a Motivation”
            The use of computer in making art creates a very different way of understanding space.

            Miljenenko Horvat
            For people who only had a background in traditional art, the transformation into emerging technology is a completely different experience.

            “Microprocessors and Intelligent Sculpture”
            The idea of reflected intelligence and internal intelligence is a very interesting way of thinking.

            Why was women’s effort specifically ignored in the field of computer and technology?
            How can people increase the recognition of women’s contribution in the field of technology?
            How did computer influence the creation and understanding of art?</p>

            It is very interesting to learn about the history of graphical user interface, which essentially supports our massive internet world today. GUI changes the meaning and usage of computer by transforming it from a professional machine to an easy-to-use communication tool for the mass. The users are given the opportunity to easily access the functions of these new technologies through the use of graphical information. Similar to many other industries, despite the fact that the industry started with the idea to escape from the main stream pressure, the high-tech industry itself excludes outside population, namingly the non-white population. Therefore, the design of GUI, “an abstracted representation of a person’s relationship to a machine,” incorporates the underlying idea of “white neutrality.”

            How did the invention of GUI build towards the digital world we have today?
            How is the design of GUI related to the exclusive culture of the Silicon Valley?
            How can be technologies made more accessible for marginalized populations?</p>

            In the very beginning of the development of the internet, people expect the users to explore a larger world through the internet, expanding our perception of the world. However, after the internet went viral, what really happened is that the internet builds a echo chamber/filter bubble for each of us. We see what information we want to see; we join communities that have the similar opinions as ourselves; and the recent invention of algorithm in social media pushes this tendency to the extreme. In the end, the internet doesn’t expose people to new thing but just reinforces our same old way of thinking over and over again. It’s very interesting to see how someone who knows the internet from an early stage thinks about the internet world. It is so intuitive for me, someone grew up in the world of internet, to see today’s internet as how it should always be like.

            How well can human predict the future?
            What does the creation of the virtual world mean to our existence?
            How can one’s cyber-identity different from one’s physical identity? And how does this change the communication between people in the digital world?</p>

            In the contemporary world, digital technology has changed the way people communicate. This change is not merely about being able to chat with someone online or post content on social media. It permanently changes the relationship between people. It turns out to be a strange phenonmenon: while people worry about their privacy being invaded everyday, people also feel lonely and constantly feel the lack of attention and care from other people. Today, we are viewed more by the technology and less by other people. Our profiles, identities, and interests are no secret to the databases. They are constantly working to come up with things we may like, but that doesn’t fullfill our emotional needs.

            Why do people feel uncomfortable under surveillance?
            What is the difference between the gaze of a machine and the gaze from a human? What is the rationale behind how we think about them?</p>

            We’re having more and more advanced technology to create a virtual world that is so similar to the reality: 60 fps, 120 fps, 4D images, 8D images, virtual reality, and more. This route seems to be able to expand endlessly. There seems to be an urge to achieve as close to the reality as possible in the media industry, but there is also a wave in the media industry that is working backwards on this trend. Poor image, which seems to be a distorted version of reality, in fact, can be a more realistic representation of the reality.

            How does the emergence of internet changed our communication?
            How close do you think we can achieve reality in the virtual world?
            What connections we make when we see a poor image?</p>

            Algorithms, along with numbers, science and other scientific fields, are often sought to be completely neutral. Supposedly, they will be able to view everything from a subjective perspective. However, since codes are in fact created by human, they can’t be neutral. They are designed and influenced by the group of people who created them. As internet becomes an inseparable part of people’s everyday lives, its influences also exceed beyond our control. It reinforces the ideas of the people who created them, and it is harder for the one who doesn’t get to speak at the beginning to speak in the future.

            Why is the bias in algorithms seem to be so hidden at first?
            How do the bias in algorithms may influence the field of representation in our society?
            Can computer and algorithms be truely neutral and subjective?

            This week’s reading connects to the idea of the status-quo story I learned from another class. In that class, we watched a documentary about coding bias. It is not until very recently that I realized how codes and algorithms may be biased. Codes and algorithms are essentially created, designed, and managed by not only human but a small portion of human. Thus, the codes we have today are influenced by their views. Since codes and algorithms have such a big influence on our lives today, this creates a system of power. For the code to be more inclusive and equal, the future code writers would need to be aware of what they write and how it may influence our society.


            How can we increase the voice of the underrepresented people in coding?

            It is hard for people to be actively aware of many microaggression and bias in code writing. How can we improve on this?

            How to better regulate the field of algorithms and math?

            Technology is the extension of human power over nature, themselves, and other human. Code and computing, no matter how neutral they may seem to us today, are nevertheless a form of technology. They execute whatever human input into them. They are powerful tools, and people have fear towards their power. Ever after the emergence of robots and artificial intelligence, there were movies, fictions, and stories about how robots can destroy humanity. However, we often ignore the human force behind these techonologies. The people are the power that are actually influencing our lives through the use of technologies.

            Comparing reality to the fictional dystopian works, what are the differences? What are the same?

            Is it possible to use algorithm in social security while keeping it neutral and not oppressive?

            If you can introduce one regulation to the use of algorithmic technology in our society, what would you propose?

            Modern technology is commonly thought to be a tool that improves people’s living experiences and expands human power. However, this power is not evenly distributed among the population. While some people benefit more from these technology, others may not even have access to the technology due to various reasons. It turns out that the use of these technology may increase the disparity between people’s power.

            If 100% is the goal that we should move towards in terms of technology accessibility, to what extent do you consider the technology in our world today is serving the disadvantaged people?

            How can accessibility design influence and inform about the power system in our society?

            In the ted talk, Christine Sun Kim is teaching us about ASL using something that we already understand, music. How can similar practices be implemented to inform people with cognitive differences about the world?
